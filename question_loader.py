    Main function to load questions, present them to the user, calculate scores, generate feedback,
    analyze results, and save the results to a JSON file.
    The function performs the following steps:
    1. Loads the question bank from a JSON file.
    2. Retrieves cognitive and skills questions from the question bank.
    3. Randomly selects a subset of cognitive and skills questions.
    4. Presents the selected questions to the user and collects their responses.
    5. Calculates the cognitive and skills scores based on the user's responses.
    6. Prints the cognitive and skills scores.
    7. Generates and prints feedback for cognitive and skills scores.
    8. Analyzes the cognitive and skills results and prints the analysis.
    9. Compiles the results into a dictionary.
    10. Saves the compiled results to a JSON file.
    Note: The function assumes the existence of the following helper functions:
